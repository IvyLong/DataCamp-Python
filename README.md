# Welcome to the Python Programming Course

This course is structured as a series of interactive workshops to ensure you gain hands-on programming experience in Python.

## Who Is This Course For?

- **Absolute Beginners:** If you're new to programming, you'll learn to code in Python from the ground up.
- **People with Some Python Experience:** If you already know a bit of Python, you'll deepen your understanding and expand your abilities.
- **Intermediate Users:** If you're already comfortable with Python basics, you'll learn best practices and explore commonly used techniques and libraries to write better, more efficient code.

## Who Is This Course NOT For?

- **Seasoned Python Developers:** If you're already highly proficient in Python, this course may move too slowly for you.
- **Experienced Software Engineers:** If you've mastered another programming language and are efficient at picking up new ones independently, you may find more value in self-directed advanced resources.

## What to Expect in a Workshop

- Each workshop is divided into three modules.
- For each module, your coach will guide you through key concepts.
- You'll work in groups on hands-on exercises designed to help you apply and reinforce the knowledge from each module.

## Course Workload

- **Workshops:** There will be two workshops each week lasting for four weeks, with hands-on practice during each session.
- **Take-home Assignments:** You will complete two take-home assignments during the course, where you'll apply your learning to solve real-world-inspired problems.
