Here's the content for a section on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for your Python course:

# Python Workshop: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Define and use classes and objects to structure data and behavior
- Understand and implement attributes and methods within classes
- Utilize inheritance and polymorphism for code reuse and flexibility
- Apply encapsulation to hide internal details
- Work with multiple inheritance and method overriding
- Use private variables and name mangling for secure variable management
- Implement class and static methods for class-level functionality

## 1. Classes and Objects

### Classes

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data and functionality together.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
```

### Objects

Objects are instances of classes, representing specific data configurations.

```python
print(type(my_car))  # Output: <class '__main__.Car'>
```

---

## 2. Attributes and Methods

### Attributes

Attributes are variables that hold data about an object.

```python
print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota
print(my_car.model) # Output: Corolla
```

### Methods

Methods are functions defined within a class and describe the behaviors of objects.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine has started.")

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.start_engine()  # Output: Engine has started.
```

---

## 3. Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows classes to inherit characteristics from other classes.

```python
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, make, model, battery_size):
        super().__init__(make, model)
        self.battery_size = battery_size

my_electric_car = ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model 3", 75)
print(my_electric_car.make)  # Output: Tesla
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated through a uniform interface.

```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

def make_sound(animal):
    print(animal.sound())

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
make_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof!
make_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow!
```

---

## 4. Encapsulation

Encapsulation restricts access to certain components and can be implemented via public and private access specifiers.

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount(100)
account.deposit(50)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 150
```

---

## 5. Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.

```python
class Flyable:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying...")

class Bird(Animal, Flyable):
    def sound(self):
        return "Tweet!"

bird = Bird()
bird.fly()   # Output: Flying...
make_sound(bird)  # Output: Tweet!
```

---

## 6. Method Overriding

Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method from its superclass.

```python
class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent.")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Child.")

child = Child()
child.greet()  # Output: Hello from Child.
```

---

## 7. Private Variables and Name Mangling

Private variables are intended to be accessed only within their class, using name mangling to avoid collision.

```python
class SecureClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__secure_var = 42

secure_object = SecureClass()
# print(secure_object.__secure_var)  # AttributeError
print(secure_object._SecureClass__secure_var)  # Output: 42
```

---

## 8. Class and Static Methods

### Class Methods

Class methods operate on the class rather than instances, using `@classmethod`.

```python
class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"Class method called. Class: {cls}")

MyClass.class_method()  # Output: Class method called. Class: <class '__main__.MyClass'>
```

### Static Methods

Static methods don't modify class or instance state, using `@staticmethod`.

```python
class Utility:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

print(Utility.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
```

## Exercises

1. **Classes and Objects**
    - Create a class `Book` with attributes `title`, `author`, and `pages`. Instantiate an object and print its details.

2. **Attributes and Methods**
    - Extend the `Car` class to include a method that calculates fuel efficiency based on distance traveled and fuel used.

3. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
    - Implement a base class `Shape` with a method `area()`, and derive classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` with their specific implementations.

4. **Encapsulation**
    - Create a class `PasswordManager` with a private attribute for a password and methods to set and validate the password.

5. **Multiple Inheritance**
    - Define `Person` and `Employee` classes. Implement a `Manager` class that inherits from both.

6. **Method Overriding**
    - Create a `Printer` class with a method `print_document()`. Override this method in a `ColorPrinter` subclass.

7. **Private Variables and Name Mangling**
    - Implement a class with a private attribute and demonstrate accessing it using name mangling.

8. **Class and Static Methods**
    - Design a `MathOperations` class with a class method to update a constant value and a static method to perform a calculation with it.

## Key Takeaways

- Classes and objects are fundamental to OOP, allowing you to model real-world entities.
- Inheritance and polymorphism provide powerful means to extend and customize behavior.
- Encapsulation and private variables contribute to data protection and integrity.
- Class and static methods offer functionalities tied to the class level rather than instances.
